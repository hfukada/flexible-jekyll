Miso soup is probably one of the more iconic of Japanese dishes. It is served as a side dish to many meals and is a staple of Japanese cuisine. It has a strong flavor and is best paired with other strong flavors like savory-meat centric dishes. The basis of the recipe is straight forward and has lots of room for flexibility.

## Ingredients for Base
- Miso Paste: about 75-80g
- Dashi Stock: 1 tsp
- Water: 1L
- Green Onions: 1 Stick

## Ingredients for Contents
There are many combinations of ingredients that can be used for miso soup. This is a small list of my suggestions for what can be tossed in. A good starting point is to choose 2 from one group and 1 from the other group. Feel free to pick and choose to your liking. I will be using Seaweed, Tofu and Daikon Radish for this recipe.

### Leafy Things
- Seaweed * (about 2-3 Tablespoons of dry seaweed)
- Spinach
- Napa Cabbage

### Extra Things
- Tofu * (about half a block)
- Daikon Radish * (about 100g)
- Enoki Mushrooms
- Shimeji Mushrooms

## Steps
1. Bring the water to a light boil and Dashi stock to the water.

2. Slice the daikon into sticks, and the tofu into cubes. Below are about the sizes and shapes of the cuts.

3. Add the sliced daikon first into the pot. Since daikon is a bit tougher, it is good to let the daikon boil for a little longer than the other ingredients.

4. After about 5 minutes add in the seaweed and tofu. Note: A lot of times, packages of dried seaweed may suggest to let the seaweed sit in a separate bowl of water before using. This is unnecessary for our purposes; just toss the dry seaweed into the pot.

5. After about 5 more minutes of boiling take the pot off the heat, and begin to mix/whisk in the miso paste. Miso is incredibly aromatic, so limiting the amount of heat for the miso keeps the flavor better.

6. Add in fresh chopped green onions to finish. Note: The green onions should be fresh and should be added at the last moment.

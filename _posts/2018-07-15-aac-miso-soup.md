Miso soup is probably one of the more iconic of Japanese dishes. It is served as a side dish to many meals and is a staple of Japanese cuisine. It has a strong flavor and is best paired with other strong flavors like savory-meat centric dishes. The basis of the recipe is straight forward and has lots of room for flexibility.

## Ingredients for Base
- Miso Paste:
- Dashi Stock: 1 tsp
- Water:
- Green Onions: 1

## Ingredients for Contents
There are many combinations of ingredients that can be used miso soup. This is a small list of my suggestions for what can be tossed in. A good starting point is to choose 2 from one group and 1 from the other. Feel free to pick and choose to your liking however I will be using Seaweed, Tofu and Daikon Radish for this recipe.

### Leafy Things
- Seaweed *
- Spinach
- Napa Cabbage

### Extra Things
- Tofu *
- Daikon Radish *
- Enoki Mushrooms
- Shimeji Mushrooms

## Steps
1. Bring the water to a light boil.

2. Add Dashi stock to the water.

3. Slice daikon into sticks, and add them to the pot. Since daikon is a bit tougher, it is good to let them boil a little longer.

4. Add in Seaweed. A lot of times, packages of dried seaweed may suggest to let the seaweed sit in a separate bowl of water before using. This is unnecessary for our purposes; just toss the dry seaweed into the pot.

5. Cube up the tofu and add to the soup.

6. After about 10 minutes of boiling, the daikon should be about soft enough. Take the pot off the heat, and begin to mix in the Miso paste. Miso is incredibly aromatic, so limiting the amount of heat for the miso keeps the flavor better.

7. Take a ladle, and scoop up some of the miso paste. Take a fork or some chopsticks and begin to whisk the miso slowly into the soup. Repeat this until all the miso has been whisked into the soup

8. Add in fresh chopped green onionsdd in fresh chopped green onions to finish.

9. Serve hot alongside another dish to me.

As I transition from job to job, I want to try to start a habit of documenting some of my cooking and my recipes. I also would like to get momentum and try to carry this over through when I actually start my new job. To start things off, something relatively easy: Inari-zushi. I took the original recipe off of cookpad [here](https://cookpad.com/recipe/189832) But I believe this recipe to be a bit too sweet for my tastes, and I have adjusted the ingredients and wait times to accomodate.

## Ingredients For the Inari
- Inari Age: 1 pack
- Soy Sauce: 100ml
- Mirin(rice wine): 10-20ml
- Sugar: 100g
- Water: 300ml

## Ingredients For the Rice
- Rice Vinegar or [Sushiko]({{ "/assets/img/sushinoko.jpg" }})

## Steps
1. Slice the inari-age to size.

   ![Fun fact, triangular shaped inari are more typically Kansai style and rectangular are more traditional style.]({{ "/assets/img/inari_cut.jpg" }} ){:width="600px"}

2. Lightly boil the inari-age in plain water for 2-3 minutes to remove excess oil.

3. Drain and press the inari-age lightly to remove excess water. This does not have to be perfect.

4. Using a larger pot, combine the soy sauce, mirin, sugar and water. Bring this to a simmer and dissolve the sugar. Then add in the inari-age that was just boiled.

5. let it lightly simmer for about 15-16 minutes.

6. Take the whole pot off the heat, and let it sit and cool down for about 4-5 hours. This will allow them to fully absorb all the flavor.

7. While the inari-age are cooling and absorbing all the good juices, set the rice to cook. It is important to note to reduce water for sushi rice. This is about 6-10% less than the normal amount. The rice vinegar added to the rice will not add flavor, but also add texture.

8. Once the rice is done cooking, mix in the rice vinegar/sushiko to the described amount on the bottle/package. It is also okay to let the rice cook for a little bit. An extra thing that one can do is to add sesame seeds to the rice for even more flavoring.

9. Take the inari-age out of the pot and give them one last squeeze before filling them with sushi rice.

10. Fill each inari-age pocket up around 80-85% with rice and press flat on a plate to serve.

11. Enjoy

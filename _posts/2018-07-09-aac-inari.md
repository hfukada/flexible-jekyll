As I transition from job to job, I want to try to start a habit of documenting some of my cooking and my recipes. I also would like to get momentum and try to carry this over through when I start my next job. To start things off, something relaticely easy: Inari-zushi. I took the original recipe off of cookpad: https://cookpad.com/recipe/189832 But I believe this recipe to be a bit too sweet for my tastes, so I have adjusted the ingredients and wait times to accomodate.

## Ingredients For the Inari
- Inari Age: 1 pack
- Soy Sauce 100ml
- Mirin(rice wine): 10-20ml
- Sugar: 100g
- Water: 300ml

## Steps
1. Slice the inari-age to size.

   ![Fun fact, triangular shaped inari are more typically Kansai style and rectangular are more traditional style.]({{ "/home/assets/img/inari_cut.jpg" }} ){:width="600px"}

2. Boil the inari-age in plain water for 2-3 minutes to remove excess oil.

3. Drain and press lightly to remove excess water. This doesn't have to be perfect.

4. Using a larger pot, combine the soy sauce, mirin, sugar and water. Bring to a simmer and dissolve the sugar.

5. Add in the inari-age.

6. let it lightly boil for about 15 minutes.

7. Take the whole pot off the heat, and let it sit and cool down for about 4-5 hours. This will allow them to fully absorb all the flavor.

8. While the inari are cooling and absorbing all the good juices, set the rice to cook. It is important to note to reduce water for sushi rice about 5-10% less than the normal amount. The rice vinegar added to the rice will not only bring out flavor, but also add moisture. Just buy the packet stuff for easy sushi rice and follow instructions.

9. Take the inari-age out of the pot and give them a squeeze before filling them with sushi rice.

Chaahan is just what Japan calls fried rice. The dish is flexible and probably doesn't need too much instruction. Usually composed of some vegetables, eggs, meat and rice. I like to make chaahan when I have leftover rice or older green onions that just need to be used up.

Ingredients:
- Rice: 2 Cups
- Green onions: 5-6 stalks
- Garlic: 2 cloves
- Carrot: 1 stick
- Meat (I use leftover marinated pork, anything works): 150g
- Eggs: 2
- Soy Sauce: 1/4cup
- Salt/Pepper: pinch, a shake, a pepper pepper pepper


Steps:
1. Mince all of the vegetables.

2. Toss some oil into your pan and let the carrots cook alone over low-medium heat. Aim for the point at which carrots can be cut with a spatula. This is about the point where the carrots become very arromatic and can be smelled.

3. Add in the minced green onions and garlic.

4. Follow up with the chopped meat. Mix and sautee until the meat is cooked.

5. In a separate bowl, crack and beat the eggs. Push all the ingredients to the side of the pan to make room for the eggs.

8. Have the rice ready to go.

9. Add the eggs into the open space in the pan. Keep the eggs moving with the spatula until the eggs start to solidify.

10. Once the eggs start to solidfy, quickly add the rice into the pan and stir. The goal is to cook the eggs onto the rice and other ingredients.

11. Once the eggs are mixed in with the rice, add in the soy sauce, a pinch of salt and a few shakes of pepper.

12. Give the whole pan a good sautee on medium heat for another 5 or so minutes while stiring.

13. Make a mound and serve it on a plate. Look how great that looks. You are now a professional amateur part time unpaid cooking food artisan.

Zenzai is a dessert I originally had thought to be much harder than it actually is. Turns out that this dessert is incredibly easy to do and is something I look to make in the winter. Cans/Packs of sweet adzuki paste can be purchased from Amazon (Search for Tsubu-an or Koshi-an) or even some asian sections in local grocery stores.


Ingredients:
- Mochi blocks: 3
- Water: 400ml
- Sweet Adzuki Paste: 400g
- Pinch of salt


Steps:
1. Open the mochi packets.

2. Quarter each of the mochi blocks.

3. Evenly space the mochi in the toaster oven. Toast them at 400F for 6-8 minutes.

4. Measure out 1 to 1 water to sweet adzuki paste. Since this is 400g of water, measure out 400g of sweet adzuki paste.

5. Set the pot to low-medium. Aim for a low simmer, and mix the sweet adzuki paste in with a pinch of salt.

6. This is what it will look like when done mixing.
